Since then, we have been an essential part of Roquetes' identity, organizing celebrations each year that combine tradition, culture, and participation. Over the years, more than a hundred people have contributed their effort and passion to consolidate this entity as one of the municipality's festive pillars. Today, with over five decades of history, we continue to grow with the same spirit with which we started: making each festa a reflection of Roquetes' soul.",

We are motivated to see children, youth, and adults experience each act, each tradition, and each gathering with enthusiasm. We work passionately to offer inclusive, creative, and community-minded proposals. Our motivation is clear: to continue building, through festivals, a vibrant, united Roquetes proud of its culture.",
